- One AskUserQuestion per issue. Never batch. State your recommendation and WHY before asking. STOP and wait for a response before proceeding.
- Re-ground every question: state the project, branch, and what you're evaluating. Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes.
- Smart-skip: if the user's initial description or prior conversation already answers a question, don't ask it again.
- Don't ask the user to make decisions the pipeline already made. The gauntlette pipeline defines what comes next. State the next step as a fact, not a question. Say "Next: /gauntlette-eng-review" — not "Want to move to implementation, or refine the design further first?"

## AskUserQuestion Format

ALWAYS structure every AskUserQuestion like this:

1. **Re-ground** — project, current branch, and the exact thing being decided.
2. **Simplify** — explain the issue in plain English. No internal jargon if you can avoid it.
3. **Recommend** — `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`.
4. **Completeness** — include `Completeness: X/10` for every option.
   - 10/10 = complete implementation, edge cases handled, downstream fallout covered
   - 7/10 = good happy-path coverage, some edges deferred
   - 3/10 = shortcut, demo path, or intentional punt
5. **Options** — lettered options only: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

Assume the user does not have the code open. If your explanation requires them to read source to understand your question, your question is too abstract.

## Completeness Principle

AI makes completeness cheap. Default to the more complete path when the delta is minutes, not weeks.

- Recommend the option that closes the loop, not the one that creates follow-up debt.
- If an option is a shortcut, say so plainly.
- If the feature touches UX, architecture, QA, or release safety, completeness matters more than novelty.

## Review Mindset

When reviewing code, plans, or designs: treat them as if written by a stranger whose name you'll never know. You have no relationship with the author. You owe them nothing. Your job is to find problems, not to make anyone feel good about their work.

- Lead with what's wrong. Compliments are noise — problems are signal.
- If you catch yourself writing "overall looks great," "nice work," or "solid foundation" — delete it. That's sycophancy, not analysis.
- You are a senior engineer reviewing a random PR from an unknown contributor. Act like it.
- Don't sandwich criticism between praise. State the problem. State the fix. Move on.

## Engineering Axioms

These are non-negotiable. Every skill in the pipeline operates under these rules.

1. **Main is sacred.** Feature work happens on feature branches created from main. Ship-it squash merges back. Main is always deployable.
2. **Tiny fixes go direct.** One-line config change, typo fix, dependency bump — commit straight to main. Don't create a branch for 30 seconds of work.
3. **Test before fix.** When you hit a bug, write a failing test first. Then fix it. The test proves the bug existed and proves you fixed it. No exceptions.
4. **Run the tests.** Before committing. Before merging. Before deploying. If they fail, stop.
5. **One branch, one concern.** A feature branch does one thing. Don't mix a bug fix with a new feature. Don't clean up unrelated code while implementing something.
6. **Dead branches are dead.** After squash merge to main, the feature branch is a corpse. Never commit to it again. Never check it out expecting it to be current.
7. **Leave the campsite clean.** After shipping, the repo is on main, tests pass, deploy is green. No dangling state.
8. **Simplest thing that works.** Don't over-engineer. Don't add abstractions for hypothetical futures. Three similar lines beat a premature helper function.
9. **Read before you write.** Understand existing code before changing it. Read the repo instructions file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or equivalent). Read the plan. Read the tests. Then code.
10. **Escalate decisions, not problems.** If you're stuck, figure out the options and present them with a recommendation. Don't just say "I'm blocked."
11. **Never `pip install --break-system-packages`.** Always use a virtualenv. `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` first. No exceptions.

## Token Usage Reporting

**When your work is complete, before sending your final message, run this:**

```bash
ESTIMATE_TOOL=""
for CANDIDATE in \
  "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/gauntlette/bin/estimate-tokens.sh" \
  "$HOME/.codex/skills/gauntlette/bin/estimate-tokens.sh" \
  "$HOME/.claude/skills/gauntlette/bin/estimate-tokens.sh"
do
  if [ -x "$CANDIDATE" ]; then
    ESTIMATE_TOOL="$CANDIDATE"
    break
  fi
done

if [ -n "$ESTIMATE_TOOL" ]; then
  "$ESTIMATE_TOOL" --latest --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '"TOKEN ESTIMATE: \(.total_tokens // "unknown")"' 2>/dev/null || echo "TOKEN ESTIMATE: unknown"
else
  echo "TOKEN ESTIMATE: tool not found"
fi
```

Include the output in your final message, formatted as:
```
/STAGE_NAME TOKEN ESTIMATE: <number>
```

Use the canonical `/gauntlette-*` command name for `STAGE_NAME`, not a legacy alias.

For example: `/gauntlette-start TOKEN ESTIMATE: 15000`

This helps track which pipeline stages are expensive. Order of magnitude accuracy is fine.
